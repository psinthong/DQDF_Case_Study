# DQDF_Case_Study
A case study of applying DQDF (Data-Quality-Aware Dataframes) to an exploratory data analysis.
This case study is modeled after an online [Jupyter notebook](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-in-python-the-ultimate-guide-2020-c63b88bf0a0d) that illustrates an exploratory data analysis on a [housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/data) to predict housing price fluctuations.
